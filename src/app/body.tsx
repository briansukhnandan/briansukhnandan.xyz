                <Td>
                  This MakerHack was focused upon renovating the beloved 
                  neighborhood Dumbo in Brooklyn without hindering any small 
                  businesses. We created a map of Dumbo which used LED strips 
                  (controlled by the Arduino) to represent open businesses 
                  to ensure that construction wouldn't hinder them.

                  Technology by creating tools that one may use in the industry.
                  Worked in a team of 2 to design a GUI to display symptoms that
                  may occur at a randomly selected body part. Makes use of Tkinter
                  and the Priaid API.

                  This CUNY Hackathon we decided to build a standard HTML page named
                  Plan-It Eco which allows users to create events surrounding
                  environmental cleanup or de-trashing. The events are then posted
                  on the homepage of the website, similar to a messaging board like Reddit.

                  and sustainability. Worked in a team of 3 to design a 2D Top-Down RPG 
                  named "Shuttle Trouble" based around the idea of repairing a space ship. 
                  Features a handful of scripts written in C# to enhance gameplay such 
                  as a combat system, bosses/enemies, etc.
