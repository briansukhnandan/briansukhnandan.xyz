Never realized how many train operators also appreciate railfanners! Even had one compliment my dyed hair which was neat. This also commemorates the start of this blog! Let's hope I can actually stay consistent with something this time...",

    "body": "I decided to head over the Hudson River and railfan some stuff in New Jersey! I caught some pretty cool engines: PATH trains, some NJ Transit, and a bonus Amtrak catch! The only downside was how infuriating it was to obtain a SmartLink card for entering the system. I ended up just using my MetroCard until I got into Newark and needed to purchase one. Side note, but after visiting DC and getting the Cherry Blossom SmarTrip card, the one for PATH looks gross. If you want to see what the SmarTrip card I am referencing looks like, please go visit my twitter @DBZ_Returns!",
