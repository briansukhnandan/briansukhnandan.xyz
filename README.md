# My Personal Website
- Run with `npm run dev` after running `npm ci`
- This site is deployed with Vercel

## Motivation
- I wanted a site a little more minimalistic. I felt my last personal website had a lot going on, not to mention the code itself was starting to get unmaintainable because it was developed when i was beginning to learn HTML/CSS/JS fully.
- My site is inspired slightly by Luke Smith (lukesmith.xyz), however I strive to have a little more "bloat" to my website than some would like.

## Adding a Blog Entry
- Add an object entry to blog/blogs.json with a `title`, `date`, and `body`.
- Optionally you can pass in an `images` key which is a string array containing paths to `public/images/blog/`.
